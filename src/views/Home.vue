        <p>I'm Alex, software engineer working in and around Amsterdam, and this is my website.</p>
        <p>
            My work is mostly web development, full-stack, with a crush on Javascript. Meaning that I do most things in Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some people call that frontend development. :-)
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're interested in how I work, <a href="https://github.com/acazacu/nvent" title="github.com/acazacu/nvent" target="_blank">check out the github repo</a> that runs this website.
        </p>
        <p>
            About this website, it is <a href="http://vue.js" title="vuejs" target="_blank">a vuejs app</a> running in your browser and talking to an AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/" title="What is serverless?" target="_blank">serverless architecture</a>.
            More on that, in the github repo.
